Reviewing the talks and tutorials submitted to a conference can be dauntingâ€”there is much to consider, and usually, there are more great submissions than slots available in the conference schedule.

We'd like to make our reviewing process and guidelines transparent to every submitter and attendee. This will both show you what will await you during the conference as an attendee and help you understand our decisions regarding your submissions as a submitter.
