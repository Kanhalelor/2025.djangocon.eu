<!-- TODO: complete review team -->
<!-- Our review team comprises 6 people from the organizer team and one from outside. We are a mix of organizers, some core developers and DSF (Django Software Foundation) members, and some Django Girls members/organizers. -->

Reviewers will be asked to review a set of submissions and submit a review (both a few words and a rough rating). After the review period is over, we will go through the talks by category and select the talks based on the accumulated reviews. If we can't decide between two or three talks, we'll check back with the reviewers and ask them for their opinions.

Of course, we'll let you know regardless of the outcome of the review. We'll probably send out some of the acceptance emails before the rejection emails to allow accepted speakers to step back in case they cannot attend after all. Regardless of our decision, feel free to ping us for feedback, and we'll give you an overview of reviewer opinions!

We value your feedback. If you have any questions or concerns or wish to volunteer for the review team, please contact [content@djangocon.eu](mailto:content@djangocon.eu).
