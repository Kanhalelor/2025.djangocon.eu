title: lightning talks
layout: simple

Are you not up to a full talk or tutorial? Are you looking to give your first talk at a conference? Lightning talks are 5 minutes or less on almost any topic you want, with or without slides! Even if you’re nervous or shy, remember: it’s a MAXIMUM of 5 minutes. Every day of the conference will feature a lightning talk slot at the end of the day. Sign-ups will happen **during the conference**.
Please note: While lightning talks are informal and flexible, they must still adhere to the conference's <a href="../../conduct/code_of_conduct" class="pages-links">Code of Conduct</a>
