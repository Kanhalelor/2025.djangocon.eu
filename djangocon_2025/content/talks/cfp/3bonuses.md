As a speaker, you will not need to buy a ticket since you will gain free entrance to the conference. Of course, if you bought a ticket in advance before being accepted, we will refund it. If you are not selected as a speaker, don't worry; you are still eligible for an early bird ticket.

For companies or employers: The content of a talk should not be directly influenced by commercial interests, but if your company or employer has supported your process for creating and giving the talk (for instance, allowing you to prepare it during working hours), you are _always_ welcome to mention this support during a talk.
