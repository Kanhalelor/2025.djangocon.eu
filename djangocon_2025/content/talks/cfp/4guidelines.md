- Submit your talk on time; no excuses.
- All talks will be **in English**.
- Read, understand, and agree to our Code of Conduct. As a speaker, your talk and slides will need to follow our Code of Conduct – if you are unsure what that means or have some issue you are unsure about, just ask us!
- Make sure you spend some **time and effort** on your proposal. Typos, lack of formatting, and half-finished sentences are unnecessary and make it hard for your proposal to be taken seriously. Ask a mentor or a friend to help if this is difficult for you.
- **Don't overdo it** – Two or three paragraphs are plenty of space to give us an idea of your talk, and we don't require an entire thesis. ;)
- **Original content:** Since we have little space and many submissions, we prefer original content. If your talk is so awesome that you want to give it in multiple places, we'd ask you to consider putting a new spin on it, if possible.
