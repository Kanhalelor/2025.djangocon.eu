DjangoCon Europe has a dedicated Code of Conduct Active Response Ensurers (CARE) team, which will generally handle any reports. However, other organizers and volunteers are sometimes the first point of contact or may observe incidents themselves.

In general, as a conference representative, you should be aware that other participants will look to you for appropriate behaviour within the Code of Conduct.

When you are an organizer or volunteer not on the CARE team, the general guidelines for observing an incident or receiving a report are:

- If you can easily find a member of the CARE team, do that, and let them handle the incident from there on. In that case, you don’t need to do anything else. If you were a witness, the CARE team may ask for more information later.
- If you can't easily find a CARE team member, write down the details of the incident: what happened, who was involved, when and where this happened, whether the incident is ongoing, and how we can contact the reporter. If someone is reluctant to provide some of this information or doesn’t know, do not pressure them.
- If possible, the reporter can also send a mail to <a href="mailto:conduct@djangocon.eu" class="pages-links">conduct@djangocon.eu</a>. This is helpful, as it gives the CARE team a first-hand written account.
- In any case, could you pass the details you noted to a CARE team member as soon as possible?
- If you'd like to, please try to arrange for an escort by staff or a trusted person, help the reporter contact a friend, or contact local law enforcement. Please don't do any of these actions if the reporter doesn't want them.
- Do not share any of the information with anyone else.

When speaking to a reporter, be cautious in your wording. Try to be understanding and compassionate, and make them feel heard and taken seriously. However, do not make commitments about whether the conference will see this as a violation or what action will be taken.

In urgent cases, where it is impossible to contact a CARE team member, and you think immediate action is essential, you may intervene unilaterally. For example, you may consider this:

- When any delay of action is likely to bring unacceptable further harm to others. Ongoing aggression or severe harassment are examples of this.
- If you feel people are in immediate physical danger, it can be appropriate to contact local law enforcement.
- If you witness a presentation clearly violating the Code of Conduct repeatedly or very seriously. You might say, “I’m sorry, this presentation cannot be continued now.”. Examples of when this is justified could be significant threats of violence, harassment of others, or continuous sexist jokes. Do not end a presentation in cases like a few inappropriate jokes - in that case, report it to the CARE team.

Even in these cases, you can consult with another organizer or volunteer if you see one nearby.
