This is a guide for the organizers and volunteers of DjangoCon Europe on handling <a href="/conduct/code_of_conduct/" class="pages-links">Code of Conduct</a> (CoC) reports. This guide mainly aims at conference staff to help us deal with incidents professionally and reduce the risk of mistakes. This is especially important because conferences are stressful and involve significant time pressure. However, it's always possible that particular circumstances require a deviation from this guide.

Some parts of this guide discuss very severe incidents, like ongoing violence. These events are not expected at DjangoCon, but we want to be as prepared as reasonably possible for anything from the most common minor incidents to the most severe cases.
