Childcare at DjangoCon Europe and tech conferences more generally is an important factor that helps folks attend who otherwise may not be able to. We want to make sure that parents feel welcome bringing their children to DjangoCon Europe and that the availability of childcare is not a barrier to attending.

The Childcare Application Opening was on March 1st. The closing date for grant applications will be May 5th, 23:59 UTC.
We look forward to seeing you - and your kids - soon in Vigo!
