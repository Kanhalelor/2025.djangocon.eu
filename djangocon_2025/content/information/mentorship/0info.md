### **For Mentors**

As a mentor, your role is crucial in guiding mentees toward successful submissions. Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Answer Questions:** Address any queries mentees may have about their proposals.
2. **Clarify Expectations:** Help mentees understand the key details required in the proposal form.
3. **Provide Feedback:** Offer constructive advice to improve and refine proposal drafts.
4. **Identify Gaps:** Pinpoint areas where information is lacking or overly detailed to ensure clarity and focus.

### **How the Program Works**

Our aim is to pair each mentee with a dedicated mentor to foster one-on-one guidance. To simplify scheduling, we prioritize matching participants in the same timezone or country whenever possible.

Once the pairing is complete:

1. **Introductions:** Mentors and mentees will be introduced via email.
2. **Prepared Materials:** Mentees will be encouraged to share their draft proposals or ideas for review.
3. **Asynchronous Collaboration:** We recommend starting with asynchronous feedback, allowing flexibility for busy schedules.
4. **Optional Meetings:** If both parties agree, they can arrange video calls or virtual check-ins independently.

This flexible format ensures accessibility while empowering participants to collaborate in ways that work best for them.
