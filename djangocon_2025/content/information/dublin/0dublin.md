title: DUBLIN
layout: simple

Welcome to **Dublin**, a city that’s as intimate as a village and as friendly as an Irish pub. Framed by mountains, centred on a river and edged by a beautiful bay, the city’s streets and alleys are filled with vibrant art and historic buildings, hip cafés
and traditional "old ma" pubs, as Dubliners call them.Walk the streets and you’ll feel the energy of over 1,000 years of history, as echoes of the Vikings mix with buzzing boutiques, cobbled streets reverberate with the sounds of buskers, and 18th century parks play host to festivals, film and food markets.
