title: Getting around
layout: simple

Vigo is a small city and you can walk almost everywhere, although Vigo is well-known for its hills (so be prepared to walk up and down!). Nowadays, there are a lot of escalators to help you with that.
To get around in Vigo and if you want to go to nearby beaches, the best option is public transportation, bus or taxi.


### By bus
